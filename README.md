# SOLESURVIVOR

CHATLOG 25A.D MARCH 11th - 7:05PM

L: Our studies have proven the subtetonic shifting hypothesis. Former contenents have seeemingly merged with the ocean floor, leaving our contenent as the sole survivor.


A: Does it really count as a single conentent with the seaway splitting it in half?


L: MWISW is still shallow enough to allor the two bodies of land to be connected.


A: Do we have an idea of when the sinking started opposed to when South America fully sank under the Earth's mantle?


L: Not Ncessarily. With previous connections with other Contentents being cut off, we never had an indication or message from former civilization of contentent sinking.


A: The initial devide between civilation almost caused more damage then the actual sinking. The time it took for the former contenents to fully submerge was so quick, contenental shifting like this should take millions and millions of years.


L: Instead it appears to have been in a matter of months. Even worse, the expedidated covergant evolution of apex preditors rendered oversea travels impossible.


A: Meaning?


L: No survivors.


A: Fucking Hell


A: This is insane, Levi. The population is on the rise and we are running out of space. With the atomosphere being as fucked up as it is, we can even fly let alone contue to built up! We hardly have any plant life anymore either, everything is being plowed down to create more residential areas. Not a single peice of land is left over for wwildlife to even survive. Mass extinctions of common plants and animals is contibuting to the starvation of the country. Fuck, even trying to gather reasources from the ocean is a life-threatening career now. Political figures are seriously considering more and more... lethal acts... to keep the population undercontol.


L: I know.


A: We're running out of fucking time, here, Levi.


L: I know.


A: ...how much government funding do we even have left?


L: Enough for one last expedition.


A: I can't watch any more people die under our incompetence, Levi.


L: Ada, I know this will be the last trip. Theres something out there that has the last peice I need for this. The world is evolving without us, but I know we can use it to our advantage. Please, just trust me.


A; Do you treally think your little Hybrid Human Kin experiment can fix this? 


L: Yes.


A: I trust you.
